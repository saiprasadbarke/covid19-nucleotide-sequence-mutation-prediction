COVID-19 Nucleotide Sequence Mutation Prediction
==============================

Using deep learning methodologies (GAN, VAE, Transformer, RNN) to predict the mutations in Nucleotide sequences of the COVID-19 virus.

Getting Started
------------
```angular2html
1. cd CondaRequirements/
2. conda env create -f environment.yml
